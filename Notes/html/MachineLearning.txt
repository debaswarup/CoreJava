1. Find patterns in data
2. Use patterns to predict future
Ex: Detecting Credit Card Fraud, Detecting whether a customer will switch to the competitor

Data -> MachineLearningAlgo -> Model -> Application
We supply Data with patterns to MachineLearningAlgo and it finds a model in the data, which is then fed into an Application who can use it to predict.
MachineLearning lets us find/use a pattern in existing data and then creates a model that recognizes the pattern in new data.

MachineLearning= Predictive Analytics

> R is an ope source programming language and environment
