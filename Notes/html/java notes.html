ArrayList vs LinkedList...<br>
ArrayList-<br>
Maintains Array of element internally.<br>
Use System class feature ArrayCopy or ArrayShifting for inserting element.<br>
Search is fastre since index is maintained.<br>
LinkedList-<br>
Maintains nodes...with pointer to both prev and next node.<br>
Insertion at first position or deletion from any position is faster.<br>

<br>
Abstract class - <br>
Ø If at 1 or n number of methods are abstract then class has to be declared as abstract. Class has to be declared as abstract if at least one method is abstract. <br>
However, if a class is abstract then it is not mandatory that at least one method should be abstract.<br>
Ø Abstract class is never instantiated. However it can have constructor. Abstract class constructor is called while instatiation of child class through super().<br>
Ø Instance variable of abstract class can never be abstract. <br>
  (Abstract modifier is not permitted for instance variable, only public, protected, private, volatile, transient, final are permitted.)<br>
  <br>
Interface - <br>
Ø By default all methods are public, abstract. Only public and abstract modifiers are allowed for methods in interface, no other method is allowed. <br>
If any other modifier is mentioned, it will give compile error.<br>
Ø By default all instance variable of Interface are public, static and final. No other modifier is allowed for instance variable in Interface.<br>
Ø Since every instance variable is final, and there is no constructor, all instance variable has to be initialized during declaration.<br>
(Otherwise they become blank final variable)<br>
Ø Interface can not have constructor.<br>
Ø Can extend 0..* Interfaces.<br>
Ø Can not extend any class.<br>
Ø Can not implement Interface.<br>
  <br>
NOTE: Interface in java provides Multiple Inheritence feature.  <br>

Set<br>
 |__HashSet<br>
 |__LinkedHashSet<br>
 |__TreeSet<br>
 <br>
Set - <br>
Ø A collection that contains no duplicate elements. <br>
Ø Sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element.<br>
Ref - <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Set.html> <br>
HashSet- Hashtable bucket concept….non synchronized……… n time space for basic operation<br>
LinkedHashSet - HashTable and LinkedList implementation of Set interface…Preserves the natural order in which elements are added.<br>
TreeSet - Tree structure implementation of Set interface……..  By default ASC sorted order….. Log(n) time cost for basic operations….<br>
<br>
HashTable - <br>
Ø Key- Value<br>
Ø Non null key<br>
Ø HashCode and Equals method<br>
Ø Performance - initial capacity and load factor<br>
Ø Hash Collision - Single bucket stores multiple keys<br>
Ø reHash method - when no of elements exceed loadFactor * initialCapacity<br>
Ø Load factor inversely propertional to space where as directly propertional to time<br>
Ø Synchronized - throws concurrent modificationException<br>
<br>
Map<br>
 |__HashMap(One Null key many null values.....Not synchronized)<br>
 |__TreeMap(Sorted order ASC bydefault...Log(n) time...Tree implementation...Not synchronized...)<br>
 |__HashTable<br>
 |__LinkedHashMap(natural order preserved...linked list implementation)<br>
 <br>
To synchronize HashMap<br>
Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(….))<br>
