Common stock - A security that represents ownership in a corporation.
Preferred stock
> If both types of stock exist, common stock holders cannot be paid dividends until all preferred stock dividends are paid in full.
> In the event of bankruptcy, common stock investors receive any remaining funds after bondholders, creditors (including employees), 
  and preferred stock holders are paid. As such, common stock investors often receive nothing after a bankruptcy.
> On the other hand, common shares on average perform better than preferred shares or bonds over time.
> Common stock usually carries with it the right to vote on certain matters, such as electing the board of directors. 
  However, a company can have both a "voting" and "non-voting" class of common stock.  
> There is no fixed dividend paid out to common stock holders and so their returns are uncertain
> Similar to bonds, preferred stocks are rated by the major credit-rating companies

Apache Tomcat Facts:
Tomcat always maintains the context or modules in server project inside the workspace. In fact all the tomcat related configuration files
can be found in the same server project inside current workspace.
Also tomcat config files are stored at temp folders inside server plugin of Eclipse (E:\JAVA\testGWT\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core)
How to add a new Server Project if existing Server project is corrupt:
Eclipse -> Create New Server Project.
Example Error: "Two or more Web modules defined in the configuration have the same context root (/TestTomcatWebApp1). To start this server you will need to remove the duplicate(s)."
Also New servers can be added from Eclipse -> windows -> Preferences -> Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working with CXF:
1. create a dynamic web project
2. Add index.html to the Webcontent folder
3. Add a new tomcat server if not already added to the worspace/project
4. Test run the web project to see if it is working. That is on the web browser the index.html that is the welcome file should be displayed.
5. Add a servlet to the project. (Servlet require library servlet-api.jar which can be found inside tomcat lib directory)
